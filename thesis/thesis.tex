% Columbia Astronomy PhD Dissertation Template
%
%
%
% Current version : March 2019
% Andrew Emerick generated this blank template from a version sent to him by
% Sarah Pearson. Sarah got this from Susan, who got this from Stephanie, 
% who got this from Jennifer Weston. Jennifer got this from Munier Salem,
% Munier got it from Yuan Li.
%
% Munier said:
% Yuan Li sent me this, which she got from Lia Corrales. Then Yuan 
% made changes based on Destry's version Yuan got from Jenna. TeX 
% format adapted from the thesis of Destry Saul, which was adapted largely 
% from the thesis of Takamitsu Tanaka, which was adapted from Emily C. 
% Rauscher which was adapted from David Spiegel, and so on and so forth, 
% probably since dinosaurs.
%
% This version hacked to include elements from Adrian Price-Whelan's, which
% was modified to include elements from Jos? Koiller's
