# Papers


Repositories for my published papers. These should be mostly pruned (i.e. published versions only)
of the works, but this is definitely not always the case. If I ever get around to it, I will
go through and prune messy directories of unneeded (mostly extra images) files.

Complete citation information for each paper is included in the `citation.bib` files in 
each directory.

This repository is not complete. It does not include papers where I was a co-author, and
is missing first-author papers prior to 2018 (of which there are 3).

Titles for each paper are copied below:


Emerick+2018a:

    Stellar Radiation Is Critical for Regulating Star Formation and Driving Outflows in Low-mass Dwarf Galaxies 

Emerick+2018b:

    Metal Mixing and Ejection in Dwarf Galaxies Are Dependent on Nucleosynthetic Source

Emerick+2019:

    Simulating an isolated dwarf galaxy with multichannel feedback and chemical yields from individual stars
